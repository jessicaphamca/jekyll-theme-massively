## About our Site

With a Bachelor's degree in Finance followed by Master of Business Administration, I transitioned from academia to professional roles across retail and financial services. Recognizing the growing importance of data analytics, I pursued and completed a Post-Degree Diploma in Data Analytics at Langara College. I now work in a data-related role, applying my analytical skills to derive actionable insights from data. My aim is to leverage my education and experience to drive informed decision-making and positive outcomes.
