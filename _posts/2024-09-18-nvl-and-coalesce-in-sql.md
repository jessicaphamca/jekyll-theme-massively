## Introduction

In SQL, handling NULL values is crucial to ensure our queries return meaningful results. Two commonly used functions for dealing with NULL values are NVL and COALESCE. While they may seem similar at first glance, there are key differences in how they operate and their performance. This post will explain the syntax, usage, and differences between NVL and COALESCE so we can choose the right function for our specific needs.

### What is NVL?

NVL is a function specific to Oracle databases that replaces a NULL value with a specified replacement. It’s simple and commonly used, especially in Oracle environments.

**Syntax:**

```sql
NVL(expression, replacement_value)

How it works:

If expression is NULL, replacement_value is returned. If expression is not NULL, its value is returned.

Example:

SELECT NVL(salary, 0) AS salary FROM employees;

If the salary is NULL, the function returns 0; otherwise, it returns the actual salary.

What is COALESCE?
COALESCE is a standard SQL function that is more versatile than NVL and can be used across different database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle). It returns the first non-NULL expression from a list of expressions.

**Syntax:**

COALESCE(expression1, expression2, …, expression_n)

How it works:

It checks each expression in order and returns the first non-NULL value. If all values are NULL, it returns NULL.

Example:

SELECT COALESCE(salary, bonus, 0) AS income FROM employees;

In this example, COALESCE checks if salary is NULL. If it is, it checks bonus. If both are NULL, it returns 0.

Key Differences Between NVL and COALESCE
Number of Arguments: NVL only accepts two arguments (expression and replacement). COALESCE can accept multiple arguments and checks them in order, returning the first non-NULL value.

Portability: NVL is Oracle-specific. If we use NVL in databases like MySQL or SQL Server, it will not work. COALESCE is part of the SQL standard, making it portable across different database platforms.

Performance: In Oracle, COALESCE is optimized better than NVL because COALESCE is evaluated as a case expression. It short-circuits the evaluation, meaning if it finds a non-NULL value early, it stops checking the rest of the expressions. NVL, on the other hand, always evaluates both arguments, even if the first is not NULL, which can lead to performance overhead if the second argument is expensive to compute.

Data Type Handling: NVL performs implicit data type conversion when the arguments are of different data types. For example, if the first argument is a string and the second is a number, Oracle will attempt to convert the second argument to match the first argument’s data type. COALESCE does not perform implicit data type conversion. All arguments must be of compatible types, or it will return a data type error.

Example of Data Type Conversion:

SELECT NVL(325, 'good') FROM dual;

This query would succeed in Oracle as it converts 'good' to a number (0). However, the following COALESCE query would fail:

SELECT COALESCE(325, 'good') FROM dual;

Handling Multiple Values: NVL cannot handle more than two values, so it is less flexible. COALESCE allows multiple values, which can simplify the logic when dealing with multiple fallback options.

# When to Use NVL vs. COALESCE?

### Use NVL if:
Work exclusively with an Oracle database.
Only need to replace NULL with a single alternative value.
Data type conversion is not an issue.

### Use COALESCE if:
Need to support multiple databases (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Want to check multiple expressions for NULL values.
Performance and type safety are important in the use case.

## Conclusion

NVL and COALESCE are both useful for handling NULL values in SQL queries, but they differ in functionality, performance, and portability. For Oracle-only applications with simple two-argument replacements, NVL can be a convenient choice. However, COALESCE is more versatile, supports multiple database platforms, and handles multiple expressions, making it a better choice for more complex or cross-platform use cases. By understanding the differences between these two functions, we can write more efficient and portable SQL queries that handle NULL values effectively.
